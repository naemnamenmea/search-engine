During these tribulations, La Hire, accompanied by Anthony de
Chabannes, the bourg de Vignolles his brother, and about two hundred
combatants, passed one day near to the castle of Clermont in the
Beauvoisis, of which the lord d'Auffemont was governor. He was no way
alarmed at their appearance; and, as a mark of his good will, ordered
wine to be drawn, and carried without the postern of the great tower,
for them to drink.
