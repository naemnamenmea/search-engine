The lord d'Auffemont came also out of the castle, with only three
or four of his attendants, to converse with them, and showed great
courtesy to La Hire and his companions, not having the smallest
distrust of their treacherous intentions, which they very soon made
apparent; for during the conversation, La Hire laid hands on him, and
forced him to surrender the castle, putting him withal in irons and in
confinement. In this state, he kept him upwards of a month, insomuch
that his limbs were greatly bruised and benumbed, and he was covered
with lice and all sorts of vermin.
